 **these are the databases the code works with:**  
[https://raw.github.com/fabiantheblind/world.geo.json/master/countries.geo.json](https://raw.github.com/fabiantheblind/world.geo.json/master/countries.geo.json)  
[https://raw.github.com/fabiantheblind/moreTimeForDesign/javascript/indesign/jsonfiles/World_nuclear_test_sites.json](https://raw.github.com/fabiantheblind/moreTimeForDesign/javascript/indesign/jsonfiles/World_nuclear_test_sites.json)  
**this is the image used:** [[https://github.com/fabiantheblind/moreTimeForDesign/raw/javascript/indesign/radiation_warning.bmp](https://github.com/fabiantheblind/moreTimeForDesign/raw/javascript/indesign/radiation_warning.bmp)

 and here: [https://github.com/fabiantheblind/world.geo.json/zipball/master](https://github.com/fabiantheblind/world.geo.json/zipball/master)   
the folder structure is like this:  
in (folder) Scripts Panel in (folder) moreTimeForDesign

 via git  
 git clone git://github.com/fabiantheblind/moreTimeForDesign.git
